# Senti
Senti is a sentiment analysis app concept built using Google Cloud, Twitter Kit and, RxSwift, based on the MVVM pattern.

By giving a Twitter username, the app will list the latest user's tweets. When I tap one of the tweets, the app will visually indicate if it's a happy, neutral or sad tweet.

For this first release, the app will only support the English language.

We are using Twitter's official API to fetch user's tweets:<br>

Google's Natural Language API to process the sentimental analysis:<br>
